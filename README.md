## **Introduction**

To help the owner of a coffee shop franchise in New York City get a better understanding of purchase behavior and streamline operations, I analyzed six months of sales data from January 2023 to June 2023. 
The main goal of the project was to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business. To reach that goal, I created a dynamic dashboard using Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to visualize the overall revenue trend of the stores, the most popular drinks and foods, and the transaction numbers during the day and the week. 

The data were organized in a single worksheet with 11 fields and 149,116 records. They had records of transaction date and time, store ID and location, and name and category of the purchased product.
After familiarizing myself with the data and performing a basic data cleaning to ensure the quality of the data, I started adding some calculated columns like Revenue, Month, Day of the week, and Hour. These steps were necessary to further break down the data to a more granular level. 


## **Key Findings**

1. **+104%** in Revenue from **$81,678** in January to **$166,486** in June
2. **7-10** am are peak hours for transactions 
3. Tea and Coffee are the most popular product categories, while 
4. Saturday is the least for transaction numbers in general, while if we look at the single store, we can see different patterns. Astoria and Hell's Kitchen have their lowest transaction numbers on Saturday, while Lower Manhattan on Sunday.
5. Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee, and Barista espresso are the most popular products.
6. Scone is the top seller for bakery products, with a total revenue of $36,866. It's in the Top 10 of products per number of transactions.

## **Impact**

1. Improved staff shift management by identifying peak hours, enabling the allocation of additional personnel to handle increased demand.
2. Reduced customer waiting time during busy periods by aligning staffing levels with peak usage trends.
3. Identified the top-selling bakery product, providing insights into customer preferences and guiding the development of similar products to meet customer tastes better.
