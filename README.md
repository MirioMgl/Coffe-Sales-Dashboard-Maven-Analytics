## **Introduction**

To help the owner of a coffee shop franchise in New York City get a better understanding of purchase behavior and streamline operations, I analyzed six months of sales data, from January 2023 to June 2023. The data were organized in a single worksheet with 11 fields and 149,116 records. 

The project goal is to create a dynamic dashboard to analyze sales data for a fictional coffee shop franchise in New York, Maven Roaster, and obtain useful insights to help the business.

> You've recently become a franchise owner at Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.
> To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, you've collected  transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.

The Project assignment: 
>To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, you've collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023.
